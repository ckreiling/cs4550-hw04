Web Dev Fall 2018 HW04 Status

Answer the following questions:

1. What's your name?
Christian Kreiling


2. What's the URL of the github repo with your work for this HW?
https://github.com/ckreiling/cs4550-hw04


3. What's the version number of your github release?
I don't have a version number. Instead, I made a new repo for hw04, with 
the same git history as hw03.


4. What's the URL that you deployed to?
hw04.porchboys.com/



5. Is your game functionality complete? If not, what's missing?
The game is entirely functional, however there is one stand out bug after
resetting the game - the first card you click flips over a different card.



6. Is your game properly deployed? If not, what went wrong?
It is properly deployed to the URL specified above.



7. How did you handle cards flipping back after a set timeout?
My server accepts only 2 messages from the client,"tile_clicked"
and "reset_game". After a user clicks a tile, there is a message pushed
to the game's channel with the tile's ID, no matter what. The state as 
a result of that click is broadcasted to all subscribers of the 
given channel. The function that's called when a tile is clicked only
changes the state if the state isn't frozen on the server (:frozen 
value is "true" in the state).

After the state is changed, if the server state froze the game, the channel
sets a timeout using "Process.sleep/1", which calls the "unfreeze function" at
expiration and then broadcasts the resulting state to all subscribers.

The cards flip back when the new state comes down the pipe with the
result of the "unfreeze" function call on the server.

tldr; all state is held on the server so only after a message is
sent to the client tagged as "new_game_state" will anything change.
